# Mythv3 For sonoyuncu
dont ask any questions

Discord: https://discord.gg/XxNqkhhK65

how it works

it connects the error and input stream of bootstrap to myth minecraft thats a completely different process for get session id (yes thats how sonoyuncu bootstrap and launcher communicates)
myths jar is dumped sonoyuncu 7 september jars fixed version for connect sonoyuncu what it does is just canceling C03PacketPlayers in login lobby and disables some funny checks xddd

code is very shitty we know please dont blame us

for project;

  use [this](https://workupload.com/file/BEuvJB67DPp) jar as library and then out with it
